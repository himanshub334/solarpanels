The Solar Panel Monitoring System (SPMS) is a real-time, IoT-enabled solution designed to enhance the performance and maintenance of residential solar energy systems. Built around the ESP32 microcontroller, the system utilizes the ACS712 sensor to measure current and the INA219 sensor for voltage measurement, with calculated power and irradiance levels derived from the collected data. Integration with the Blynk IoT platform allows for wireless monitoring and visualization through a smartphone app, enabling users to track solar output remotely. The system detects issues such as dust accumulation or shading, helping to optimize solar efficiency and reduce maintenance downtime. Emphasizing cost-effectiveness, low power consumption, and ease of deployment, SPMS is a practical solution for smarter, more sustainable energy monitoring in residential settings

1. Introduction
With the growing emphasis on renewable energy adoption, particularly in residential and small-scale solar installations, the need for efficient and real- time solar panel performance monitoring has become increasingly vital. Solar panels, while generally low-maintenance, are susceptible to various environmental factors such as dust accumulation, bird droppings, and partial shading from trees or nearby structures. These factors can lead to significant reductions in power output, often going unnoticed until energy yields drop substantially.To address this issue, our project proposes a smart and compact Solar Panel Monitoring System (SPMS) built entirely around the ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 is an ideal choice due to its integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, low power consumption, and versatile I/O support. The system is designed to continuously acquire real-time data from the solar panel using two key sensors: the ACS712 current sensor, which provides accurate current readings, and the INA219 voltage/power sensor, which is capable of measuring both voltage and power consumption over an I2C interface.The collected data is processed onboard the ESP32 to compute critical parameters such as real-time power (in watts) and solar irradiance, which can be estimated by analyzing the voltage-current characteristics relative to panel ratings. This data is then transmitted wirelessly to a mobile application dashboard built using the Blynk IoT platform. Users can remotely monitor the system’s performance through intuitive interfaces such as real-time graphs, gauges, and notifications.
An important feature of this system is its ability to identify performance anomalies. By monitoring trends in power output and comparing them against expected baseline values, the system can infer issues like panel contamination or shading. When such deviations persist, the system can generate alerts—prompting users to inspect and, if necessary, clean their panels. This initiative-taking maintenance approach helps maximize energy efficiency and reduces long-term performance losses.

Literature Review:
In recent years, the increasing adoption of solar energy in residential and small-scale applications has spurred the development of various solar monitoring systems. Early systems primarily relied on microcontrollers such as the Arduino Uno or Mega, with data logging accomplished via SD cards or GSM modules for remote access. Although functional, these solutions often lacked real-time visualization, offered limited interactivity, and required additional hardware for cloud-based connectivity. Moreover, their functionality was typically restricted to basic parameters such as voltage and current, offering little to no insight into dynamic performance metrics like power output trends, efficiency variation, or the environmental effects of factors such as shading and dust accumulation.

1. Sensor Use for Solar Measurements
The choice of sensors is critical in achieving accuracy and responsiveness in solar monitoring systems. The ACS712 current sensor is widely used due to its simplicity, affordability, and ability to convert analog current readings into voltage signals compatible with most microcontrollers. While it serves well for basic current measurement, more advanced monitoring systems benefit from integrated solutions like the INA219 sensor, which combines voltage, current, and power measurements into a single device using a digital I2C interface. This compact, low-power sensor enhances the performance of real-time systems and is especially useful in IoT-enabled, battery-operated applications. Its precision and digital output make it an ideal choice for scenarios requiring simultaneous measurements with minimal processing overhead.

2. IoT Integration for Real-Time Monitoring
The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly expanded the capabilities of solar monitoring, making systems more intelligent, responsive, and user-friendly. The ESP32 microcontroller has become a preferred platform for these applications due to its built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, dual-core processor, and low-power operation. This eliminates the need for separate communication modules, reducing system complexity and cost. When integrated with platforms like Blynk, ESP32-based systems enable real-time remote monitoring through smartphone dashboards, allowing users to track live data, view historical trends, and receive fault alerts from anywhere. This level of connectivity transforms conventional solar setups into smart energy systems, making them more transparent, efficient, and easier to maintain
